## The Bat-Coder

Hello! I am Ted Jablonowski, and this small portfolio website I made will hopefully be the start of something special. I am currently enrolled in MSU and have started my journey! I call myself the "Bat-Coder" because I'm a huge Batman fan (quite obviously) and want any prospective employers and any who may need my services to know that they are hiring an individual with passions and interests! I have finally fully rolled the beginning stages of my portfolio with more to be added over the next several months! 

As time goes on I will put more of my newly aquired skillsets into this to showcase what I'm capable of.
